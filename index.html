				<h2>Why is everyone picking LEOT</h2>
				<p>We do not think of ourselves as just another tutorial center. We believe that learning does not have to be tedious. By providing students with a warm and accepting environment, we make sure that every student feels welcomed and feels encouraged to learn. We strive to make LEOT as afforable as possible while still providing the best education possible. Every question will appear like a puzzle, and the student will be provided all the secrets in solving it. We know that we WILL make a difference, which is why the first session is FREE! If you love us, you can enroll. If not, you never need to come back again, but we really think you’ll love us.

						</p> <br>
						<p>I came here to help me get into Spence School. I was nervous about not being able to get in the school, but after coming to LEOT, my tutor made each question feel like a game and everything started flowing after. I GOT IN! - <strong>Ushrat A.</strong>

						<p>I was enrolled in the SHSAT program and I learned a lot. I learned what was going to be on the SHSAT and how to deal with each question. Because of this, the SHSAT felt easy for me. - <strong>Sudman K.</strong>
						</p> <br>
						<p>I have learned so much at LEOT Tutorial. It’s been five months since I started coming here and I learned everything I needed to know about Algebra. It really helped me prepare for the Regents exam. - <strong>Rumaysa</strong>
