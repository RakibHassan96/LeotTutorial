			<h2>Md Azad</h2>
			<p>We do not think of ourselves as just another tutorial center. We believe that learning does not have to be tedious. By providing students with a warm and accepting environment, we make sure that every student feels welcomed and feels encouraged to learn. We strive to make LEOT as afforable as possible while still providing the best education possible. Every question will appear like a puzzle, and the student will be provided all the secrets in solving it. We know that we WILL make a difference, which is why the first session is FREE! If you love us, you can enroll. If not, you never need to come back again, but we really think you’ll love us.</p>
