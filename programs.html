					<h2>Common Core + NY State Test</h2>
					<p>We believe that students begin good educational habits during their childhood and teenage years. That is why we have made sure to have each and every one of our tutors fully equipped with the knowledge of the new Common Core curriculum. This way, we can make sure that, with the student’s trust and hard work, the student will achieve the grades of their dreams! </p>

					<h2>SHSAT Class</h2>
					<p>Our SHSAT tutor has perfected the craft of the SHSAT. After getting into Bronx Science, he has taught many students, ranging from private tutoring to full-blown classes. He even took classes in other well-known tutorials to learn the tips and tricks provided there. By applying everything he learned from his past experiences, there is not ONE question he cannot solve. We gave him full responsibility in the job, because we know that is the BEST way to get YOU into the school of your dreams! </p>

					<h2>Regents</h2>
					<p>Regents are HARD! That’s the truth… But our tutors have excelled on them. To be hired for that specific subject, the tutor has to provide proof that he or she received at least a 90 on the exam. After that, we give them a test and a tutoring practice session to see if they really can teach the subject. We think this is the only way to make sure that we are not wasting the student’s time. Trust us when we say, we will make the regents EASY for you!</p>
